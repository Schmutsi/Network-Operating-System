# Web Server

## Introduction

The term web server can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.

-   On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files.

-   On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server. In our case, we will start by configuring a static web server and then by configuring a dynamic one.

A static web server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser (like an html file) while a dynamic web server sends its hosted files dynamically updated thanks to an application server and a database to your browser.

## Configuration

### Installing Nginx

Nginx and Apach are the two more common web server, and we choose to install Nginx to our server 1.

```
$ sudo apt-get install nginx
```

### Configuring NAT and firewall

It's necessary to modify the firewall setting to allow outside access to default web ports. Thus, we modify iptables configuration in our router.

First, in the FORWARD chain we remove the conditions of states ESTABLISHED and RELATED and accept all requests from the outside (from en3 to ens4).

```
$ sudo iptables -D FORWARD 1
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i ens3 -o ens4 -j ACCEPT
```

Then, in the INPUT and OUTPUT chains we accept all request from port 80 (http requests) and 443 (https requests) with the state ESTABLISHED. We also allow requests with the state NEW in the INPUT chain.

```
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 443 -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

Eventually, we authorize servers to access to internet through the following NAT configuration.

```
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ens3 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.9:80
```

## Creating static web

In order to display our own html page host on our server, we create this file at this following path: _/var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html/index.html_

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to sos4 web site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success! Your Nginx server is successfully configured for <em>sos4.cc.uniza.sk</em>. </h1>
<p>This is a sample page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

When we created the folder _/var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html_ we assign ownership of the directory with the `$USER` environment variable, which should reference our current system user. Besides we give permission to our web root to the folder as below:

```
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk
```

In order Nginx to serve this content, we create a configuration file with correct directives that point to our custom web root there _/etc/nginx/sites-available/sos4.cc.uniza.sk_:

```
server {
        listen 80;

        root /var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name sos4.cc.uniza.sk www.sos4.cc.uniza.sk;

        location / {
               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

Next, we enable this server block by creating a symbolic link to our custom configuration file inside the _sites-enabled_ directory, which Nginx reads from during startup:

```
$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sos4.cc.uniza.sk /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

We also uncomment the following line to avoid possible hash bucket memory problem in the _nginx.conf_ file.

```
...
http {
    ...
    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
    ...
}
...
```

Before testing, these two lines are useful to respectively check our syntax and restart the web server to enable our changes.

```
$ sudo nginx -t
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Moreover, in the file _/etc/resolv.conf_ we add the public IP address to make the web server also works on this address.

```
nameserver 192.168.1.9
nameserver 158.193.153.105
```

Eventually, we modify the _/etc/bind/primary/zone.public_ DNS zone file to be able to access our static web site on the address http://www.sos4.cc.uniza.sk in every browser.

```
www A 158.193.153.48
```

### Testing

Eventually, if all these configurations were done properly, we would be able to access to our static web site (html file host on our server) at the following address: http://www.sos4.cc.uniza.sk

## Dynamic web creation

### Installing PHP and Maria DB

First, we install MariaDB, PHP and other complementary modules.

```
$ sudo apt-get install nginx mariadb-server mariadb-client php-cgi php-common php-fpm php-mbstring php-zip php-net-socket php-gd php-mysql php-bcmath unzip wget git -y
```

### Configuring a WordPress Database

Then, we create a database and user for WordPress. WordPress will use this database to store its information, and the user to have access to the database.

In the MariaDB prompt `mysql -u root -p` we enter the following lines:

```
$ MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE wpsos4db;
$ MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER 'sos4'@'localhost' identified by 'sos';
$ MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wpsos4db.* TO 'sos4'@'localhost';
$ MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
$ MariaDB [(none)]> EXIT;
```

### Installing WordPress

After the database configuration we install WordPress by downloading the latest release of WordPress.

```
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
```

We need to adapt the file _/var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html-wordpress/wordpress/wp-config.php_ with the database and the user we have just created.

```
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */define( 'DB_NAME', 'wpsos4db' );

/** MySQL database username */define( 'DB_USER', 'sos4' );

/** MySQL database password */define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'sos' );

/** MySQL hostname */define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

### Configuring Nginx for WordPress

Next, we will need to create a Virtual Host nginx configuration file for WordPress on _wordpress.sos4.cc.uniza.sk_. We can create a new Virtual Host configuration file here _/etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress.conf_ and fill it with the following lines.

```
server {
    listen 80;
    root /var/www/sos4.cc.uniza.sk/html-wordpress/wordpress;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    server_name wordpress.sos4.cc.uniza.sk;

    . . .

}
```

We enable this server block by creating a symbolic link as we have done before.

Eventually, we connect this dynamic web site to our DNS and add a new route http://wordpress.sos4.cc.uniza.sk in the _/etc/bind/primary/zone.private_ file as bellow.

```
wordpress A 158.193.153.48
```

### Accessing the WordPress Site

When we browse the http://wordpress.sos4.cc.uniza.sk website for the first time we are redirected to the WordPress installation page.

After that we can easily connect to the admin panel of WordPress and customize our website.

As a proper French group, we decided to create a very brief website on French specialties (our French food miss us...).

![Postfix config shell image](/assets/OurWPSite.PNG 'Postfix config shell')

Because WordPress is quiet RAM-greedy, we start our website only when we want with the following command line, otherwise we stop php and mysql modules.

```
$ sudo systemctl start php7.4-fpm mysqld
$ sudo systemctl stop php7.4-fpm mysqld
```

## HTTPS set-up (SSL certificate)

An http website isn't secure s it doesn't encrypt any data from the website, we thus need to pass it to https in order to have a proper, usable website.

On the last days of the project, all websites turned inaccessible, and without the possibility to access what we created, we couldnâ€™t properly configure this part. However, here' show it should have been done:

First, we will need Cerbot.
We have to install snapd, another type of service similar to apt as the cerbot, as its version is better than the one found by apt.

once we've installed snapd, we deleted the default cerbot

```
sudo apt-get remove certbot
```

Then install the snapd version

```
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

We now make sure that cerbot will work as we want it too

```
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

Finally, we can run cerbot, either ask cerbot to find automatically all the necessary info.

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d www.sos4.cc.uniza.sk
```

and it should work as intended.
