# Logging event

## Introduction

Logging is the act of keeping a record of any event or error that occurs in the system. Looking at the logs can help a lot when debugging a system. Keeping a standard for every log is helpful in understanding the problems quickly and easily.
Syslog is the standard for message logging that we will use. It separates different messages logs by their level of importance:

![Syslog messages logs importance](/assets/syslog.png 'syslog logs messages')

We will use syslog-ng and rsyslog, two implementations of syslog for Linux.

## Configuring

On our router, we install syslog-ng:

```
$ sudo apt-get install syslog-ng
```

In it we find the file _/etc/syslog-ng/syslig-ng.conf_. We modify the code to have:

```
source s_src {
        system();
        internal();
        network (ip("0.0.0.0") port(514) transport("udp"));
        network (ip("0.0.0.0") port(514) transport("tcp"));
};
```

In here we open port 514 for udp and tcp for any ip address.
On the other servers, we need to modify the file _/etc/rsyslog.conf_, the servers originally have rsyslog installed in it.

```
local0.* @@192.168.1.1:514
```

We specify where to find the syslog server (on the 192.168.1.1 interface for server1 and server2, for server client, we need to change the address to 192.168.2.1).

Now we need to log our events directly from bind9, for this we need to modify a few lines on the device that owns our DNS: server1.

On server1, we add a line on the file _/etc/bind/named.conf_

```
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.syslog";
```

That will ask bind to take into consideration what is written on the file _named.conf.syslog_. Then we need to create this file, and fill it with this code:

```
logging {
        channel syslog_user {
                syslog local0;
                severity debug 7;

                print-category yes;
                print-severity yes;
        };

        category queries { syslog_user;};
};
```

Finally, we can check if our configuration worked by watching the logs on the file _/var/log/messages_. In here we used curl to search at google.com and watched the event appearing on the logs.
